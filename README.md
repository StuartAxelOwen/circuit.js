circuit.js
==========

circuit.js is (will be) a JavaScript Circuit Simulator.

It will be suitable for simulating circuits of moderate simplicity (like a simple delta sigma ADC) for demonstration purposes.

Dependancies
------------

circuit.js will likely rely on Raphael.js for circuit display and animation, and Numeric.js for linear algebra (in circuit analysis).
